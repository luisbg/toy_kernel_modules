Hello World Module
------------------------------------------

A Linux kernel module, and stand-alone Makefile, that when loaded prints to the
kernel debug log level, "Hello World!". The module is able to be unloaded as
well.

The Makefile is able to build the kernel module against the source of the
currently-running kernel as well as being able to accept an arbitrary kernel
sources directory from an environment variable.

Load and unload module with:
# insmod hello.ko
# rmmod hello


Alternatively:
# ln -s /path/to/module.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`
# depmod -a
# modprobe hello
# rmmod hello
