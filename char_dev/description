Toy Char Device Driver
----------------------

A kernel module for a misc char device driver.  The misc interface is a simple
way to create a character device, without having to deal with sysfs and
character device registration.

This misc device implements the read and write functions, on the device on
/dev/toychardev. Reading returns the ID, writing checks if the data to write
matches the ID.

Compile, load and unload module with:
$ make
# insmod hello.ko
# cat /dev/toychardev
# echo "not_the_id" > /dev/toychardev
# rmmod hello
